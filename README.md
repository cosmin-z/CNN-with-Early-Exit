# CNN with Early exit

This Repository refers to the Final Project of the course [Neural Networks for Data Science (NNDS)](https://www.sscardapane.it/teaching/nnds-2022/) at University Sapienza of Rome 2022/2023.

## Abstract

## Dataset

The dataset chosen for this homework is [**Corn and Maize Leaf Disease Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset) from kaggle. The authors of this dataset created it using the PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets. In this dataset we have 4188 images divided into four classes, representing some of the different states the plant leaf can be in:

* Common Rust - 1306 images
* Gray Leaf Spot - 574 images
* Blight -1146 images
* Healthy - 1162 images


The idea of using this dataset stems from my interest in plants. Moreover, maize being a plant used all over the world, the ability to recognise diseases promptly can avoid unpleasant scenarios.

The task is Image Classification.

Since my dataset is not stored separately in train/validation/test i did it myself. I divided the data as follows:

*   70% train set
*   15% validation set
*   15% test set

## First Model : CNN

I decided to use a Convolutional neural network with 4 convolutional block, a global average pooling layer and a classification block. Each convolutional block is made in this way:

* 2D convolutional layer
* Batch Normalization
* Relu as activaction function
* Max pooling layer

I decided to plot the loss and accuracy curves both for the training and validation set. We can see how, even after only a few epochs, the model immediately begins to perform well. The model manages to achieve good results in both loss and accuracy. The best model has an accuarcy of 91,5% in the validation set and a value of 89,5% in the test set.
